# Scripts

## `arcsight_syslog` - **STANDARD SOLUTION**
This script is designed to be added as a custom action in Splunk.
It **must** be used when integrating the SOC alerting system.

## `xlm_alert_forwarder_es.py` - **OUTDATED**
This script is used to forward Splunk Enterprise Security alerts (E.S.) to
XLM's SOC.

## `xlm_alert_forwarder.py` - **OUTDATED**
This script is used to forward the alerts generated by the *classic* Splunk
instances (like Splunk Enterprise).
